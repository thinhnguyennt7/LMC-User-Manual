        "QUESTION": "How much wastes produces in the past few years?",
        "FIRST_QUOTE": "In 2015, an estimated 55 percent of global plastic waste was discarded, 25 percent was incinerated, and 20 percent recycled",
        "SECOND_QUOTE": "The garbage output at Georgia Tech has been increasing at a warning rate for the past couple of years.",

        "FIRST_TITLE": "Solution",
        "SECOND_TITLE": "Transportation",
        "SOLUTION1": "The trash bins will be scattered throughout the campus where they will be linked together by pipelines placed deep underground. Right under a trash bin will be a compartment where waste will go through classification process and then sorted to be pushed to the next section.",
        "SOLUTION2": "Before entering a pipeline, trash will be preprocessed to meet requirements to fit into pipelines. Then the wastes will be transported to facilities on campus to be processed to final products and afterwards distributed back throughout the campus.",
        "PROGRESS": "Garbage collection, classification, pre-processing, transportation, and main processing.",
        "PRES": "PreS Operation",
        "PROCEDURE": "Steps Procedure",
        "COLLECT_TRASH": "Each of the garbage bin is attached to a pipeline which then drains the garbage from the bin periodically. This implies that the bin has virtually infinite capacity. This helps avoid scenarios where the bin is full and overflow as we have seen often around GT.",
        "CLASSIFICATION": "Computer Vision and Elemental Analysis will be used to classify waste to a specific category. Computer Vision mechanism will be used to recognize objects, for example an apple. It uses Machine Learning to distinguish objects by comparing an it to images in the dataset. Objects that will need more information for classification will go through Elemental Analysis where their chemical composition will be determined.",
        "PRE_PROCESSING": "Modify non-qualified objects to correct formats before entering transportation pipelines. Not all objects will be qualified to enter pipelines for example, an object may be too large to fit into pipeline. Pre-processing can be, for example, chopping objects, changing shapes, dividing different parts apart, or cleaning surfaces.",
        "TRANSPORTATION": "Waste will be transported to destination using underground pipelines. Pipelines will have a self cleaning mechanism to prevent contamination and odor. Chemicals to clean pipelines will be created in the facility using waste and then released to pipelines at the scheduled time when there will be no trash in the pipeline.",
        "FACILITY": "Trash will be sorted and sent to different facilities. Energy Facility - responsible for converting garbage into a different form of energy such as heat which is then redirected to run the pipeline or to be used as electricity. Materialistic Facility - responsible for converting objects such as plastic into reusable products. For example, plastic can be reused as 3d printing material. Composting Facility - responsible for converting food wastes into fertilizer to be used to improve soil for growing plants on campus.",
        "FINAL_PRODUCT": "The outcome of this system is that we will be able to efficiently reuse or convert the trash into different forms of material that matter in other places. This improves the efficiency of recyclable material and also helps GT to achieve the goal of being self-sustaining. The excess product can be sold for profit or donated.",

    "FAQ": {
        "TITLE": "FAQ/Troubleshooting",
        "QUESTION1_TITLE": "What will happen if an animal enter a trash can?",
        "QUESTION1_ANS": "All trash cans will have lid that would prevent animals from entering.",
        "QUESTION2_TITLE": "Is the system cost-effective?",
        "QUESTION2_ANS": "Yes, the system is cost effective since it will produce product such as heat for GT. Therefore, Georgia Tech will not have to buy it from a third party.",
        "QUESTION3_TITLE": "Does it affect nature?",
        "QUESTION3_ANS": "Our composting facility will decompost food waste and paper products into fertilizers that can be used for nurturing plants on campus.",
        "QUESTION4_TITLE": "How long does it take to build the system?",
        "QUESTION4_ANS": "It will takes approximately 3 years to build the system.",
        "QUESTION5_TITLE": "What kind of plastic can I recycle on campus?",
        "QUESTION5_ANS": "You can recycle rigid plastic bottles and containers. Make sure the bottle or container is empty prior to recycling. Please rinse off any food residue. No plastic bags, plastic film, or polystyrene foam.",
        "QUESTION6_TITLE": "Can I recycle plastic bags from the grocery store?  What if it has the number two on the bag?",
        "QUESTION6_ANS": "Yes, all plastic trash are acceptable at our trash bin. Our energy facility has a process called Pyrolysis, which can turn non-recyclable trash into energy by incinerating trash at very high temperatures ranging from 300C - 900C.",
        "QUESTION7_TITLE": "What about paper towels and tissues?",
        "QUESTION7_ANS": "We have a composting facility that decomposes food waste and paper products, so paper towels and tissue are acceptable at our trash bins."
